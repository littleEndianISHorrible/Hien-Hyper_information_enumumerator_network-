# Hien-Hyper_information_enumumeration_network-
A python project aiming to shorten the distant between information 

Purpose of project: 
The purpose of this project is to shorten the distance between information and to compress complex data into a simple token field. The basic steps.
1.	The project will demand an input data frame, 
2.	Vector the columns and values, 
3.	Laminate and tokenise the column header into the English equivalent
4.	Simplifying the nth size vector of the column English meaning into a complex function z
5.	convert the column data into a meaningful state, where all the data is on the same scale
6.	Creating vectors of where the x is the column and the y is the data
7.	The difference between these vectors is computed via a tensor
8.	The 3d tensor is then factorised and enumerated as a, b, c, d and feta
9.	the information a b c d feta are used to create a high-dimensional 5th dimensional plane as a vector. 
10.	Hence, information from the data frame can be tokenized and compressed into a single format
