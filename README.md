# Hien-Hyper_information_enumumeration_network-
A python project aiming to shorten the distant between information 

The basic principal behind the project involves a information mannagement system for a computer, 
where usefull yet complex information (which can range from definitions in a text file, to explination of terms in a video)
are compressed and dispayed in a format of a vector tree (or specific tokenizer -> multidimentional plain definied by five numbers (hence 5d space)), 
enabiling for the quick definition and accsess to said information, or chunks of information. The super tokenization is the H in Hien.

information- refers to all data or usefull user and nonuser complex relivent information.

enumumerator- refers to the enumumeration and compression of data chunk into and off the main vectorised tree.

network- refers to the idea that in the vector tree all information can be connected.

Basic back bone for the core algorithm
1.	The project will demand an input data frame(which would have already compressed information into a simplified form), 
2.	Vector the columns and values, 
3.	Laminate and tokenise the column header into the English equivalent
4.	Simplifying the nth size vector of the column English meaning into a complex function z
5.	convert the column data into a meaningful state, where all the data is on the same scale
6.	Creating vectors of where the x is the column and the y is the data
7.	The difference between these vectors is computed via a tensor
8.	The 3d tensor is then factorised and enumerated as a, b, c, d and feta
9.	the information a b c d feta are used to create a high-dimensional 5th dimensional plane as a vector. 
10.	Hence, information from the data frame can be tokenized and compressed into a single format
